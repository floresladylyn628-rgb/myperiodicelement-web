    Iodine is a chemical element, symbolized as I, and is a violet-black,
     lustrous nonmetal. It's essential for human health, particularly for thyroid function. Iodine is used in various applications, including medicine, disinfection, and iodized salt. It's also used in photography and as a contrast agent in medical imaging.
   </p>
   <p>
    Iodine was discovered in 1811 by French chemist Bernard Courtois. He isolated it from seaweed ash, and its name comes from the Greek word "iodes," meaning "violet-colored," due to its violet vapor. Initially used in medicine and photography, iodine's importance in human health, particularly for thyroid function, was later recognized.
     Today, it's widely used in various applications, including iodized salt and medical treatments.
