    Technetium is a chemical element, symbolized as Tc, and is a silvery-gray, radioactive metal. It's a transition metal with unique properties. Technetium is primarily used in nuclear medicine for diagnostic imaging 
    and research due to its radioactive isotopes. Its applications are limited due to its rarity and radioactivity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Technetium was the first element to be artificially produced. It was discovered by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè in 1937. They isolated the element from molybdenum samples that had been bombarded with deuterons. Technetium is named after the Greek word "technētos," meaning "artificial," reflecting its synthetic origin. Due to its 
    radioactivity and short half-life, technetium is not found naturally on Earth in significant quantities.
