    Copper is a reddish-orange, ductile metal with high electrical and thermal conductivity. It's an essential material in various applications, including electrical wiring, plumbing, electronics, and architecture, 
    due to its excellent conductivity, corrosion resistance, and malleability.
   </p>
   <p>
    Copper has been known and used by humans for thousands of years, with evidence of copper use dating back to around 8000 BCE. The earliest known copper mines were in the Middle East, and copper was widely used in ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley. The name "copper" comes from the Latin word "cuprum," derived from the island of Cyprus, where copper was mined in ancient times. 
    Copper has played a significant role in human history, from the Copper Age to modern industrial applications.
