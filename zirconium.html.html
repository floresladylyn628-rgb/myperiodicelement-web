    Zirconium is a chemical element, symbolized as Zr, and is a transition metal. It's a lustrous, gray-white metal that's resistant to corrosion. Zirconium is used in various applications, including nuclear reactors (for fuel rod cladding), ceramics, medical implants, 
    and specialized alloys. Its unique properties make it useful for high-performance applications.
   </p>
   <p>
    Zirconium was discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in the mineral zircon. The element was isolated in its impure form by Swedish chemist JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius in 1824. Zirconium's name comes from the mineral zircon, which is derived from the Persian word "zargun," meaning "gold-like." Initially used in limited applications, zirconium's unique properties have led to its widespread
     use in nuclear reactors, ceramics, medical implants, and other advanced technologies.
