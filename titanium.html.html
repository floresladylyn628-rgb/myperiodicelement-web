    Titanium is a strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant transition metal with the atomic number 22 and symbol Ti. It's known for its high strength-to-weight ratio, making it ideal for applications in aerospace, medical implants, sports equipment, and more.
     Titanium is also biocompatible and resistant to seawater and chlorine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Titanium was discovered by William Gregor in 1791 in Cornwall, England, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1795. Klaproth named the element titanium after the Titans of Greek mythology. The pure metal was not produced until 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter. Titanium's unique properties made it valuable for industrial applications, and its use expanded significantly during World War II. 
    Today, titanium is used in various industries, including aerospace, medicine, and sports.
