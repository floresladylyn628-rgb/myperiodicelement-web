  Flourine is pale yellow, highly reactive, and toxic gaseous element, the most electronegative of all elements. It's the first
  element in the halogen group (group 17) on the periodic table. Flourine readily forms compounds with the most other elements,
  and its reactivity is due to its small atomic size and high electronegativity.

     <p>
  Flourine was first identified in 1771 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who isolated it in the form of hydroflouric acid.
  However, in the free element, flourine gas, was not isolated until 1886 by Henri Moissan, who used electrolysis to separate it.
  Moissan's work was significant and earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
