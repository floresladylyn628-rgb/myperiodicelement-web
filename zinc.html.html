    Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous metal with a low melting point. It's essential for various applications, including galvanizing steel to prevent corrosion, producing alloys like brass and bronze, and supporting biological functions in living organisms. 
    Zinc is also used in batteries and other industrial applications.
   </p>
   <p>
    Zinc has been used by humans for thousands of years, with evidence of zinc production dating back to ancient India and China around 1000 BCE. The metal was likely discovered through the process of smelting zinc ores. Zinc was initially used in alloys like brass, but its individual properties and applications were not fully understood until later. The modern industrial production of zinc began in the 18th century, and today zinc is an essential 
    material in various applications, including galvanizing, alloys, and pharmaceuticals.
