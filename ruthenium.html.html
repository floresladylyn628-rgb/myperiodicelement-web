   <p> 
Ruthenium is a chemical element, symbolized as Ru, and is a rare, silvery-white transition metal. It's known for its hardness, brittleness, and high melting point. Ruthenium is often used as an alloying element to enhance strength 
and durability, and has applications in electrical contacts, wear-resistant parts, and catalysts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ruthenium was discovered by Karl Ernst Claus in 1844. Claus, a Russian chemist, isolated ruthenium from platinum ore residues. The name "ruthenium" comes from the Latin word "Ruthenia," meaning Russia, in honor of Claus's homeland.
     Ruthenium is a rare element and has limited applications due to its scarcity and difficulty in processing.
