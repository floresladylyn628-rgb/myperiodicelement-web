Barium is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal with the atomic number 56. It is highly reactive and never found
in its pure form in nature due to its tendency to oxidize quickly and react with water.
   </p>
   <p>
 Barium was first identified in 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele while studying the mineral barite. Barite was known 
 for its high density, which led Scheele to suspect it contained a new element, though he was unable to isolate it. The element itself
 was finally isolated in 1808 by British chemist Sir Humphry Davy, who used electrolysis on molten barium salts to extract it. He named 
 "barium" after the Greek word "barys," meaning "heavy," due to the high density of barite.
