    Beryllium is a steel-gray, hard, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that 
    occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. Beryllium is also known for its high
    strenght-to-weight ratio, high melting point, and ability to withstand high temperatures. 
   </p>
   
     <p>
      Beryllium is a rare element in the universe and is not formed during the Big Bang or in the cores Of stars. Instead,
      it is primarily produced in supernova explosions through a process called cosmic ray spallation. Beryllium was discovered(1798)
       as the oxide by French chemist Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin in beryl and in emeralds and was isolated (1828) as the metal
       independently by German chemist Friedrich Wohler and French chemist Antoine A.B Bussy by the reduction of its chloride 
       with potassium.
