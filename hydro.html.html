   <div class="firstgraph"> <p>Hydrogen is a highly flammable, colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is the lightest and 
       most abundant chemical element in the universe. Hydrogen is a highly reactive gas that forms
       compounds with many other elements, including oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. It is a key component 
       of water (H2O) and all organic compounds. Hydrogen is considered an energy carrier, meaning it can be used to store
       and transport energy. In the periodic table, hydrogen is placed in group 1(alkali metals) due to its Electronic
       configuration, but it doesn't fit perfectly with the other elements in this group due to its unique properties.
       Hydrogen is also being researched as a potential replacement for fossil fuels, as it can
                  be produced from renewable energy sources and has zero greenhouse gas emissions when 
                  burned.

                Hydrogen was discovered by Henry Cavendish, an english chemist, in 1766. Cavendish isolated hydrogen gas
                by reacting zinc with hydrochloric acid and studied its properties. He is credited with the discovery of 
                hydrogen as an element.
            
            

            
                However, Robert Boyle had previously produced hydrogen gas in 1671 by reacting iron with acid, but he didn't
                recognize it as a distinct element.
            
            
            
                Antoine Lavoisier later named the element "hydrogen" in 1783, derived from the Greek words "hydro" (water) and "genes"
                (forming), because it produces water when burned.

            
                Cavendish's work laid the foundation for later research on hydrogen's properties and uses.
