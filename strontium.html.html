    Strontium is a chemical element, symbolized as Sr, and is an alkaline earth metal. It's a soft, silvery-white metal that reacts with water and air. Strontium is used in various applications, including fireworks (for its red color), magnets, and nuclear applications. Its compounds are also used in ceramics, glass, and other materials. 
    Strontium's unique properties make it useful for specific industrial and scientific purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Strontium was discovered in 1790 by Scottish chemist Adair Crawford and English chemist William Cruickshank. They identified it in the mineral strontianite, found in Scotland. The element was isolated in its elemental form by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 through electrolysis. The name "strontium" comes from the mineral strontianite, which is named after the Scottish village of Strontian, where it was first found. Strontium's unique properties have led to 
    its use in various applications, including fireworks, magnets, and nuclear applications.
