   <p>
    Bromine is a reddish-brown, corrosive, and toxic halogen element. 
    It's a liquid at room temperature and has a strong, unpleasant odor.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bromine was discovered in 1826 by Antoine Jérôme Balard, a French chemist, in seawater and certain plants. The name "bromine" comes from the Greek word "bromos," meaning "bad smell," due to its strong, unpleasant odor. Initially, bromine was used as a disinfectant and in medicine. 
    Today, it's used in various applications, including water treatment, pharmaceuticals, and flame retardants.
