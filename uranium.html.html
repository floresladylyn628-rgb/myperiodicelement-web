Uranium is a dense, silvery-gray, radioactive metal, belonging to the actinide series. It is best known for its 
role as a key fuel in nuclear reactors and weapons due to its fissile isotopes, particularly uranium-235 and uranium-238. 
Found naturally in the Earth's crust, uranium is weakly radioactive and occurs in minerals like pitchblende and uraninite.
   </p>
   <p>
 Uranium was discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who identified it whilr
 analyzing the mineral pitchblende. He named it uranium after the planet Uranus, which had been discovered just 
 eight years earlier. Though its radioactive properties were unknown at the time, uranium gained significant 
 attention in 1896 when Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity while studying uranium salts. Later, marie and Pierre
Curie expanded on this research, further uncovering the properties of radioactive elements.       </p>
