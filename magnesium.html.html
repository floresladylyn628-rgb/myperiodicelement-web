    Magnesium is a silvery-white, moderately hard, and relatively lightweight alkaline earth metal 
    two valence electrons in its outermost energy level, making it relatively reactive. It's is highly flammable
    and burns with white light.

Magnesium was first isolated by Sir Humpry Davy in 1808 through electrolysis of a mixture of mercury oxide and magnesia
(magnesium oxide). Davy named the element after the Greek region of Magnesia, where magnesite (magnesium carbonate) was found.
Initially , magnesium was produced in small quantities, but industrial production began in the late 19th century. Today,
magnesium is produced through various methods, including electrolysis and silicothermic reduction.
