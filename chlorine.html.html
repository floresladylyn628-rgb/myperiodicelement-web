   <p>
Chlorine is a yellow-green, highly reactive, and toxic gas. It's a halogen that readily forms compounds with other elements. Chlorine's
 strong oxidizing properties make it effective against bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.
   </p>
   <p>
  Chlorine was first discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1774, a Swedish chemist, who isolated it from hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide.
  However, Scheele believed it was a compound. Later, in 1810, Sir Humpry Davy proved that chlorine was an element and named it after the 
  Greek word "chloros", meaning greenish-yellow, due to its distinctive color.
