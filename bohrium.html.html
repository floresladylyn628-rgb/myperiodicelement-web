Bohrium is a synthetic, highly radioactive element. It is not found in nature, exixts only in tiny 
quantities in laboratories, and has no known practical applications due to its extreme instability 
and short half-life. Bohrium is believed to be a metal and is chemically similar to rhenium, located
below it in group 7 of the periodic table.
   </p>
   <p>
 
   Bohrium is discovered by a German team at the GSI Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt in 1981,
   following earlier claims of synthesis by a Soviet team in 1976. It is named after the Nobel Prize-winning 
   Danish physicist Niels Bohr, and was officially named and approved by the International Union of Pure and Applied
   Chemistry(IUPAC) in 1997. Bohrium is a transuranic, radioactive element produced in particle accelerators and is 
   currently only used for scientific research.
        </p>

           Bohrium has no practical applications becuase of its extreme instability, rarity, and radioactive 
           nature, which make it unsuitable for commercial, industrial, or medical use. Its solely utility
           lies in fundamental scientific research, where it serves as a subject of study to understand the 
           behavior of superheavy elements, nuclear physics, atomic structures, and nuclear theories.
