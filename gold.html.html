   <p>
Gold is highly valued for its lustrous yellow appearance, malleability, ductility, and resistance to corrosion and 
tarnish. Found in both native form and ores, gold has been used for thousands of years in jewelry, currency, and as 
a symbol of power and wealth.
   </p>
   <p>
 
Gold has been known and valued by humans since prehistoric times, making it one of the first metals to be discovered 
and used. Its origin lies in stellar nucleosynthesis, where gold atoms were formed during supernova explosions or 
neutron star collisions, and later dispersed across the universe.
