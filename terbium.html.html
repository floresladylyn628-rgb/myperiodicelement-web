Terbium is a silvery-gray, soft, and ductile rare earth metal with atomic number 65, belonging to the lanthanide series. Terbium is 
known for its luminescent properties, particularly in green phosphors used in LEDs and displays.

   <p>
 
 Terbium was discovered in 1843 by Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander while analyzing the mineral gadolinite, which was found
 in the quarry near the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Mosander separated terbium as an impurity from yttrium oxide and named it 
 after Ytterby, the same place that inspired the names of other elements like yttrium, erbium, and ytterbium. Initially, terbium was 
 difficult to isolate in pure form due to the chemical similarities of the rare earth elements. It wasn't until advanced separation
 techniques were developed in the 20th century that terbium could be fully isolated and studied.
