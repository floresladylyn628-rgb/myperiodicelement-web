    Calcium is a silvery-white, soft alkaline earth metal with the atomic number 20 and symbol Ca. It's essential for various biological processes, including bone health, muscle function, and nerve function.
     Calcium is also used in industrial applications, such as construction and manufacturing.
   </p>
   <p>Calcium was first isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 through the electrolysis of lime (calcium oxide). Davy named the element "calcium" from the Latin word "calx," meaning "lime." The use of calcium compounds, such as limestone and gypsum, dates back to ancient times. However, the element itself wasn't isolated until Davy's experiment. Since then,
     calcium has been recognized as an essential element for living organisms and has numerous industrial applications.
