    Arsenic is a highly toxic metalloid with a gray, silver, or yellow color. It's known for its poisonous properties and has been used historically in various applications, including pesticides and medicine.
     Arsenic is still used in some industrial and technological applications, such as semiconductors and alloys.
   </p>
   <p>Arsenic has been known since ancient times, with its use dating back to around 2500 BCE. The Greek philosopher Aristotle and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote about arsenic compounds. Albertus Magnus, a medieval alchemist, is credited with isolating the element in 1250. Arsenic was widely used in medicine, pesticides, and other applications, but its toxicity led to strict regulations and caution in its handling. 
    Today, arsenic is primarily obtained as a byproduct of copper, lead, and gold mining.
