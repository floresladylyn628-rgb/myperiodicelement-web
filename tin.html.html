    Tin is a chemical element, symbolized as Sn, and is a silvery-white, malleable metal. It's used in various applications, including soldering, plating, and alloys
     (e.g., bronze, pewter, and tin cans), due to its corrosion resistance and ability to form protective oxide layers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The name "tin" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word "tin" or "tinian", while the symbol "Sn" comes from the Latin word "stannum". Tin was a crucial component in the development of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, which played a significant role in the Bronze Age.
 Throughout history, tin has been extracted from various sources, including cassiterite (SnO2), and has been used for a range of applications, from plating and soldering to making alloys and containers.
