Sulfur is a yellow, brittle, non-metallic element with atomic number 16. It has a distinctive odor and is found naturally 
in volcanic regions and in the form of sulfides and sulfates in varoius minerals. Sulfur has been known and used by humans 
for thousands of years, with ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans utilizing it for various purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
  The word "sulfur" comes from the Latin word "sulphur", which is derived from the sanskrit word "sulvere", meaning "to burn". 
  Sulfur is often associated with volcanic activity, and its natural occurrence in volcanic regions made it a readily available 
  resource.
