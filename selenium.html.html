    Selenium is a nonmetal element with properties similar to sulfur. It's essential for biological systems in small amounts, particularly as an antioxidant in enzymes. Selenium has industrial applications in photovoltaics, semiconductors, and glass production. 
    It exists in various allotropes, including gray, red, and black forms.
   </p>
   <p>
    Selenium was discovered by JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius, a Swedish chemist, in 1817. He discovered it in the sludge from a sulfuric acid plant. The name "selenium" comes from the Greek word "Selene," meaning moon. Initially, selenium was considered toxic, but later its importance in biological systems was recognized. 
    Today, selenium is obtained as a byproduct of copper refining and has various industrial and nutritional applications.
