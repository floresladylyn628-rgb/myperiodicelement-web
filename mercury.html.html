   <p>
Mercury is a heavy, silvery liquid metal at room temperature. Known since the ancient times, it is unique
among metals for its liquid state under normal conditions. Mercury is highly dense, toxic, and has a high surface tension,
which allows it to form spherical droplets.
   </p>
   <p>
 The element mercury has been known since ancient times and does not have a single discoverer. Early civilazations, such 
 as the Chinese and Eqyptians, were aware of mercury as far back as 1500 BCE. It was primarily obtained from the mineral 
 cinnabar, where it was extracted through heating. The Greeks later named it "hydragyrum", meaning "liquid silver,"
which is the origin of its modern chemical symbol "Hg".        </p>
