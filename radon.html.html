Radon is a radioactive noble gas, formed naturally as a decay product of uranium and thorium. It is colorless
, odorless, and highly dense, with significant health risks due to its ability to accumulate indoors and emit harmful
alpha radiation, making it a laeding cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.
   </p>
   <p>
 Radon was discovered in 1899 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, a German physicist, who observed that a radioactive gas(later
 named radon) was emitted during the decay od radium. It was initially called "radium emanation" (Ra Em) due
 to its association with radium, it was later renamed radon in 1923 to align with the naming of noble gases
