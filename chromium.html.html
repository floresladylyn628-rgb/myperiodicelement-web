    Chromium is a hard, silver-white transition metal with the atomic number 24 and symbol Cr. It's known for its high corrosion resistance, hardness, and ability to be polished to a high shine. Chromium is widely used in stainless steel production, electroplating,
     and as a pigment in various applications, including coatings, paints, and glass.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chromium was discovered by Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin in 1797 in France. He discovered the element in the mineral crocoite (lead chromate). The name "chromium" comes from the Greek word "chroma," meaning color, due to the vibrant colors of its compounds. Chromium metal was first isolated by Hans Goldschmidt in 1894. Today, chromium is widely used in various industrial applications,
     including stainless steel production and electroplating.
